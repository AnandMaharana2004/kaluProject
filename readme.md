this project is i make for my friend and the work is like there is a home page and other pages one of the page is email sending 
so now i work on it to send the email


the tomarow plan is just add a .gitignore file and add the node_module file and learn the pull file from the git and remove the
file


i add the mediaquary,
it work properly in phone so,,,
the next plan is make the rest pages and apter that work on email section 


overal the frontend work is finish it's time to work on backend which is just send a email to the owner of the website and it's like the user's email 


separation of conson

i think there is a problem on the responsiveness or on the @mediaquery so firt fix the error then just host it freeüòÅ
