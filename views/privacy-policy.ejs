        <div class="mainDiv">
            <p class="main-p">Welcome to our websit <span>www.goforbuy.us</span> We understand that privacy online is
                important to
                users of our Site, especially when conducting business. This statement governs our privacy policies with
                respect to those users of the Site (“Visitors”) who visit without transacting business and Visitors who
                register to transact business on the Site and make use of the various services offered by
                <span>www.goforbuy.us</span> (collectively, “Services”) (“Authorized Customers”).
            </p>
            <p class="main-p">“Personally Identifiable Information” refers to any information that identifies or can be
                used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not
                limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security
                number, and credit card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information
                that is collected anonymously (that is, without identification of the individual user) or demographic
                information not connected to an identified individual.</p>
            <p class="main-p">What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? We may collect basic user profile
                information from all of our Visitors. We collect the following additional information from our
                Authorized Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Customers,
                the nature and size of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory that the
                Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell.</p>
            <p class="main-p">What organizations are collecting the information? In addition to our direct collection of
                information, our third party service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks)
                who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect this information
                from our Visitors and authorized Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such
                information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information provided to them from
                Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as
                links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.</p>
            <p class="main-p">How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information? We use Personally Identifiable
                Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and
                selling requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers about research or purchase
                and selling opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may
                also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in response to
                specific inquiries, or to provide requested information.</p>
            <p class="main-p">With whom may the information be shared? Personally Identifiable Information about
                Authorized Customers may be shared with other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential
                transactions with other Authorized Customers. We may share aggregated information about our Visitors,
                including the demographics of our Visitors and Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and
                third party vendors. We also offer the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving information or being
                contacted by us or by any agency acting on our behalf.</p>

                collected by <span>www.goforbuy.us</span> is securely stored and is not accessible to third parties or
                employees of

            </p>
            <p class="main-p">What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and distribution of the

                obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they select. We also use
                Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized
                Customer is logged on and the site is unused for more than 10 minutes, we will automatically log the
                Authorized Customer off.</p>
            <p class="main-p">How does <span>www.goforbuy.us</span> use login information? <span>www.goforbuy.us</span>

                Site, track a user’s movement and use, and gather broad demographic information.
            </p>
            <p class="main-p">What partners or service providers have access to Personally Identifiable Information from
                Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on the Site?<span>www.goforbuy.us</span> has entered into and will
                continue to
                enter into partnerships and other affiliations with a number of vendors. Such vendors may have access to
                certain Personally Identifiable Information on a need to know basis for evaluating Authorized Customers
                for service eligibility. Our privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this information.
                Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law. We will disclose Personally
                Identifiable Information in order to comply with a court order or subpoena or a request from a law
                enforcement agency to release information. We will also disclose Personally Identifiable Information
                when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of our Visitors and Authorized Customers.</p>
            <p class="main-p">How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure? All of our employees
                are familiar with our security policy and practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our
                Visitors and Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number of qualified employees who are
                given a password in order to gain access to the information. We audit our security systems and processes
                on a regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, is
                protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect information sent over the Internet. While we take
                commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic communications and databases are
                subject to errors, tampering and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not
                take place and we will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such occurrences.</p>
            <p class="main-p">How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable Information? Visitors
                and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally Identifiable Information about them or to
                correct any inaccuracies by responding to emails as instructed.</p>
            <p class="main-p">Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the
                Site? We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to delete Personally Identifiable
                Information from the Site’s database by responding to emails as instructed. However, because of backups
                and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor’s entry without retaining some
                residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated
                will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally
                Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.</p>
            <p class="main-p">What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes? We will let our Visitors and Authorized
                Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we
                are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable
                Information that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will
                contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized Customer to prevent such
                disclosure.</p>
